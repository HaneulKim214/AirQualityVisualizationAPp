# AirQualityVisualizationApp

## Project Status: On-going

**Goal:** 
- Using real-world, real-time air quality data from around the world I will visualize using heatmap in which areas around the world are sufferring
from harsh air quality which affect everyone, especially your loved elders and children.

- Visualize using slide show about seriousness of air pollution, and provide information about AQI, how it is measured and where each pollutants
are emitted from.

- My opinion backed solution to high level of pollution around the world and future prediction.

**Why:**
- From my point of view, people are busy builidng richer life style and finding ways to complete their jobs, transportation more conviently
without thinking about consequences it brings to air quality around the world. Vehicle emissions, agricultural activities(use of pesticides, 
fertilizers, and chemicals), industrial factories, mining, and burning fossil fuels for all different activities. All these activities
are to benefit our lives which are seriously impacting the world right now. I hope to see people giving up little things to save the environment.



**Programs and Libraries used:**
- Main code: Python(pandas, flask, )
- Visualization: javascript(jQuery, d3, plotly, leaflet, planetary), advanced css3(keyframe, transitions), html5, bootstrap4
- Database: MongoDB, Realtime data retrieved [HERE](aqicn.org) using API call.
