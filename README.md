![gif](static/images/airyouokay.gif)

## Project Status: Finished

**Goal:** 
- Using real-world, real-time air quality data from around the world I will plot on a map each city's current air quality index which will be automatically updated every 6 hours within the database.

- To arouse people around the world about seriousness of air quality and its effect on our climate and our body.
- My opinion backed solution to high level of pollution around the world and future prediction.

**Why:**
- From my point of view, people are busy builidng richer life style and finding ways to complete their jobs, transportation more conviently
without thinking about consequences it brings to air quality around the world. Vehicle emissions, agricultural activities(use of pesticides, 
fertilizers, and chemicals), industrial factories, mining, and burning fossil fuels for all different activities. All these activities
are to benefit our lives which are seriously impacting the world right now. I hope to see people giving up little things to save the environment.

**How:**
- enter country name on search bar and it will render a map of the country with up-to-date air quality for everything air quality sensor within that country.
- It will also summarize text about the country from wikipedia using nlp techniques.

**Programs and Libraries used:**
- Main code: Python(sqlAlchemy, nltk, flask, pandas, beautifulsoup, etc...)
- Visualization: javascript(jQuery, d3, plotly, leaflet), advanced css3(keyframe, transitions), html5, bootstrap4
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL Realtime data retrieved [HERE](aqicn.org) using API call.
